## 1-Getting Started
This project is bootstrapped with create-react-app

## 2-Scripts
At first use npm install for installing packages
then you can run app with npm run start and run tests with npm run test

3- I tried to keep anything clear but I provided Google Draw File to can understand my architecture (mainly data flows) better:

https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1KDEjUNrQ1_cWdppNPfF2uYvycNftxgACZ6TAQSwQcAY/edit

4- You can check my components in src folder which contains UI components, timer and score

5-The main actions are happening in data folder make sure that you have visited above link before checking containing files.
Using test api's (which doesn't bahave as document says) forced me to do extra actions on fetched data but it's understandable you can check them on repository folder

6- The last part is about view:

I tried to code clear and readable but not using Redux (or Context) forced me to use useLocation for sending data between components but hope you can understand the hole process.

Hope you enjoy!
